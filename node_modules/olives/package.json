This is the realtime part of Olives.\n * LocalStore: A subtype of Emily Store for saving your model into localStorage.\n * CouchDBStore: A subtype of Emily Store for saving your model into a CouchDB database.\n\nOlives is based on Emily: https://github.com/flams/emily\n\nThe documentation for each module can be found here: http://flams.github.com/emily/ \n\n###How do I install it?\n\nOlives requires an AMD/commonJS compatible loader. I use requirejs: http://requirejs.org/\n\n```html\n\t<script src=\"./require.js\"></script>\n\t<script src=\"./Emily.js\"></script>\n\t<script src=\"./Olives.js\"></script>\n```\t\t\n\n```js\t\nrequire([\"Module\"], function (Module) {\n\t// Do what you want with Module\n});\n \nrequire([\"Olives/Module\"], function (Module) {\n\t// Olives modules are prefixed with Olives\n});\n```\n\t\t\t\t\nIf your application is based on node and you want the realtime part of Olives, on the server side, do:\n\n```\nnpm install requirejs\nnpm install olives\n``` \n\n```js\nvar olives = require(\"olives\");\n \n// Register your instance of socket.io\nolives.registerSocketIO(io);\n```\n\n###Live example\n\nThe todo application: http://flams.github.com/olives/todo/index.html\n\n###There are already so many frameworks out there, why would I choose Olives?\n\nOlives is only a set of AMD/commonJS modules. You can pick up the parts that you need, or like, and build stuff around them.\n\nIf you decide to go for all Olive's modules, then you have a set of powerful tools to create MVC applications.\n\nOlives lets you decide what piece of software best suites you and your projects.\n\n###Contributing to Olives\n\nContributors are more than welcome. To be part of Olives, a new module should follow these requirements:\n\n * It should use only standard technologies.\n * It should let native features be usable out of the box and not re-implement them.\n * It should use the latest standard features when they're the best way to achieve something.\n * It should be 100% TDD, with 100% code coverage.\n * It should be in AMD format.\n \n###Olives helps you focus on features, not on plumbing.",
