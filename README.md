If you haven't used [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://nodejs.org/) guide, as it explains how to install and use Nodejs as well as npm. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install all the plugin needed with the following shell command:

```shell
npm install
```


## Todo
  - create handler for server-main.js
  - create template for index.html (it prevents duplicate index.html for both desktop and touch devices).
  - maintainable css (with sass and audit)
  - put descriptions in wiki
