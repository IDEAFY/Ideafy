# grunt-compass

This is a custom grunt.js multitask aka [gruntplugin](http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/qzRjD/show/) that executes `compass compile` on the command line for you and prints the COMPASS output to `grunt.log.write()`.

## Dependencies

You need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) installed for this to work.

## Installation & Options

1. Install this grunt plugin next to your project's grunt.js gruntfile with: `npm install grunt-compass`.
2. Call `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-compass')` in your gruntfile.
3. Configure `grunt watch` to watch your scss files and call the task(s).
	e.g.:

	```javascript
	watch: {
	    files: ['assets/scss/*.scss'],
	    tasks: ['compass:dev', 'compass:prod']
	}
	```

4. Setup your SASS and CSS paths

	```javascript
    src: 'assets/scss',
    dest: 'assets/css'
	```

	`src` is the folder with sass or scss files and `dest` is the folder where the css files will be placed.

5. You can set your custom output style like this:

    ```javascript
    outputstyle: 'compressed'
    ```
6. You can disable line comments like this:

    ```javascript
    linecomments: false
    ```
7. If you have multiple compass tasks and you want to force compass compilation you can do this:

    ```javascript
    forcecompile: true
    ```
8. You can require a given ruby library before running commands like this:

    ```javascript
    require: 'animate-sass mylib'
    ```

9. You can add the `--debug-info` option for use with [FireSass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesass-for-firebug/) like so:

    ```javascript
    debugsass: true
    ```

10. You can set the relative assets to `true` and set an image path for the Compass spriting feature:

    ```javascript
    images: '/path/to/images',
    relativeassets: true
    ```

11. You can run compass with bundle exec if you need to as well:

    ```javascript
    bundleExec: true
    ```

12. If you have a Compass configuration file, you can use it instead of or in addition to the options in your gruntfile:

    ```javascript
    config: '/path/to/config'
    ```

    If the path is not absolute, it is relative to the directory containing your gruntfile.

13. If you have a Compass configuration file, you set the environment variable for the config.rb file:

    ```javascript
    environment: 'production'
    ```

    Then use it in your config.rb like so:

    ```ruby
    output_style = (environment == :production) ? :compressed : :expanded
    ```

13. New task: compass-clean

Sometimes it can be faster to execute `compass clean` and recompile for production instead of doing `--force` compile.
Now grunt-compass comes with a `grunt compass-clean` task that you can use when registering prod tasks in your gruntfile like:

```js
grunt.registerTask('prod', ['compass-clean', 'compass:prod']);
```

14. Run "grunt watch" and edit some SASS files :)

# An Example Setup

```javascript
compass: {
    dev: {
        src: 'assets/scss',
        dest: 'assets/dev/css',
        linecomments: true,
        forcecompile: true,
        require: 'animate-sass mylib',
        debugsass: true,
        images: '/path/to/images',
        relativeassets: true
    },
    prod: {
        src: 'assets/scss',
        dest: 'assets/prod/css',
        outputstyle: 'compressed',
        linecomments: false,
        forcecompile: true,
        require: 'animate-sass mylib',
        debugsass: false,
        images: '/path/to/images',
        relativeassets: true
    }
}
```
