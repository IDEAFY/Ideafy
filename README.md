Ideafy
======

Welcome to the Ideafy project

Ideafy is a web-based idea management and idea generation application.

It can be run on a client or deployed within an organization for internal use.

The application itself is multi-user but can also be run offline in single-user mode.

It contains three main interfaces:

- the library
- the brainstorming
- the communicaiton center

Ideafy's library
----------------

It is used to store content such as ideas, brainstorming documents or sessions.

It also allows to quickly enter or edit and idea and share it.

Brainstorming documents come in the form of card decks of four different types: people, contexts, problems and technologies

Sessions offer an overview of past brainstorming sessions and allows to replay them step-by-step.

Ideafy's brainstorming
----------------------

In the future multiple brainstorming exercises can be implemented.

As it stands now the application offers the possibility to "brainstorm" new use cases and solutions based on a user-centic approach.

User can choose between:
- quick, single user sessions with default parameters
- multi-user sessions
- custom sessions where user can alter many of the brainstorming parameters

At the end of the session, a wrap-up document is created and all ideas generated are automatically archived in the library.

Ideafy's communication center
-----------------------------

In this interface user can add "acquaintances", read/send private messages (session invites, content sharing or plain messages) or send/request "two cents" (or comments) on some specific ideas.
